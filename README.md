## 🛠 **Installation Guide**

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-media-content-generator.git
cd social-media-content-generator
```

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**

Restore and install the required dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3️⃣ **Set Up AppSettings**

In the `appsettings.json` file, add the following sections for **Groq API** and **Telex** integration settings:

```json
{
  "GroqConfig": {
    "ApiKey": "your_groq_api_key", // Add your Groq API key here
    "ApiUrl": "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions" // The Groq API URL
  },
  "TelexConfig": {
    "data": {
      "target_url": "your_telex_webhook_url" // Add your Telex webhook URL here
    }
  }
}
```

- Replace `"your_groq_api_key"` with your actual Groq API key.
- Replace `"your_telex_webhook_url"` with the **Telex webhook URL** where the generated content will be sent.

### 4️⃣ **Telex Integration Setup**

To complete the **Telex** integration:

- Add the **URL of your deployed app** (which will contain the `integration.json`) to the **Telex channel** configuration.
- Ensure that the **Webhook URL** from Telex is added to the `target_url` in the `TelexConfig` section of your `appsettings.json`.
- Specify the **number of responses** you want from the AI directly in the request or configuration.

### 5️⃣ **Start the Application**
